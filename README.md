# SolanaAddressPoisoning
basic tool for some solana address poisioning. The private key you enter is for your main wallet, which holds funds that is then distributed to generated wallets with similar addresses to target wallets, that it stores from watching all activity on the chain. It then matches these active wallets against your generated keypairs and stores them in the similar keypair file. To then find wallets that it will send a small transaction to, it looks through the activity on these active wallets, and sends a small transaction to anyone whos interacted with it. This then puts your address (which looks similar) in their history. After this, it sends all unused funds back to your main wallet, and stores the transaction info in the monitoring wallets file so you can look back at it later and see if you recieved anything. This is a work in progress, but it at least works at this stage. Contact me on telegram @ccc666333 for more info.
