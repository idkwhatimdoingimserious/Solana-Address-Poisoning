# SolanaAddressPoisoning
basic tool for some solana address poisioning. it finds active addresses with a balance above X. It stores them. It generates private keys+public keys. It tries to match active addresses that have the same starting 4 characters to public addresses we have generated keypairs for. Then, it finds people who have interacted with the active address that we have a similar address to. Then, it funds from our main wallet, to our generated keypair, to our targets who have interacted with the active wallet. After this, it sends all unused funds back to your main wallet, and stores the transaction info in the monitoring wallets file so you can look back at it later and see if you recieved anything. This is a work in progress, but it at least works at this stage. Contact me on telegram @ccc666333 for more info.
